A collection of specialized value wrappers.

Quitte was originally designed as a replacement for JavaFX beans for [Osmerion](https://github.com/Osmerion/Osmerion).
This library does not provide any advanced functionality on its own. However, it can be useful when observable values or
properties are needed.
