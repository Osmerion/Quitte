### 0.6.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- `AbstractExpression` does now define a `public` constructor. Consequentially,
  it may now be extended by consumers. [[GH-4](https://github.com/Osmerion/Quitte/issues/4)]
- Various JavaDoc improvements.

#### Fixes

- Fixed a bug that caused `ObservableList#setAll` to skip some elements. [[GH-5](https://github.com/Osmerion/Quitte/issues/5)]
  (Thanks to [SkytAsul](https://github.com/SkytAsul))
- Reduced the visibility of some accidentally exposed expression members.

#### Breaking Changes

- Several members of simple and lazy expressions had their visibility reduced
  and may no longer be accessible. These methods were considered unsafe and
  should not have been exposed in the first place. Proper alternatives are
  available.
